C Preprocessor and Macros
The C preprocessor is a powerful tool that processes your source code before it is compiled. It provides functionalities such as file inclusion, macro substitution, conditional compilation, and more. Understanding the preprocessor and macros can significantly enhance your ability to write flexible and maintainable code.

Preprocessor directives are commands that give instructions to the preprocessor. They all begin with a # symbol. Some common directives include: #include which includes the contents of a file, #define which defines a macro, #undef which undefines a macro, #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, #elif, #endif which are conditional compilation directives, #error which generates an error message during preprocessing, and #pragma which issues special commands to the compiler using standardized or implementation-specific instructions.

Macros are fragments of code that are given a name. Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the code. Macros can be defined using the #define directive.

Object-like macros are the simplest form of macros. They are similar to constants. For example, #define PI 3.14159.

Function-like macros can take arguments and are used like functions, but they are expanded inline. For example, #define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x)).

Conditional compilation allows parts of the code to be included or excluded based on certain conditions. For example:

c
Copy code
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is on\n");
#endif
There are several predefined macros in C, some of which include: __LINE__ which expands to the current line number, __FILE__ which expands to the current file name, __DATE__ which expands to the current date, __TIME__ which expands to the current time, and __COUNTER__ which expands to a unique integer each time it is used.

Here are some examples:

Example 1: Basic Macro

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14159

int main() {
    printf("Value of PI: %f\n", PI);
    return 0;
}
Example 2: Function-like Macro

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Square of %d: %d\n", num, SQUARE(num));
    return 0;
}
Example 3: Conditional Compilation

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
#ifdef DEBUG
    printf("Debug mode is on\n");
#endif
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
The C preprocessor and macros are essential tools for writing efficient, maintainable, and portable code. By mastering these features, you can greatly enhance your programming capabilities in C.
