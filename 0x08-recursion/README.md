Learning Recursion
Welcome to the Learning Recursion repository! This is a beginner-friendly resource designed to help you understand the concept of recursion in programming.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve problems. It's like solving a puzzle by breaking it into smaller pieces, solving each piece, and then putting them back together.

Why Learn Recursion?
Understanding recursion is essential for becoming a better programmer. Many common algorithms and data structures use recursion, so mastering it opens up a world of possibilities.
