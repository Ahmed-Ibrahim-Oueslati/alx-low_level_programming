README: Structs and Typedef in C
Structs in C
Structures (structs) in C allow you to define custom data types by grouping together different variables under a single name. Each variable within a struct is called a member, and they can have different data types. Structs are useful for organizing related data into a cohesive unit.

Example:

c
Copy code
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

struct Point p1 = {1, 2};
Typedef in C
Typedef is used to create aliases or alternative names for existing data types, including structs. It improves code readability and maintainability by defining custom type names that can be used throughout the program.

Example:

c
Copy code
typedef struct {
    int age;
    char *name;
} Person;

Person p = {25, "John"};
Summary
Structs provide a way to encapsulate related data, making code more modular and easier to manage. Typedef enhances readability by introducing custom type names for structs and other data types, promoting clearer and more expressive code.

This README provides a brief overview of both structs and typedef in C, emphasizing their roles in data organization and type aliasing.
